# invasive-non_invasive-identifier
This project use Convolutional Neural Network on invasive plant species "parthenium hysterophorus" to help detect whether given plant is invasive or not.
This project implements Convolutional Neural Network using Keras to ease labelling of images.
I have used images of most common and abundant invasive plant species of India named "parthenium hysterophorus" or "carrot grass" or "Gajar ghans" in regional language.
This project will help detect invasive species by common people thus minimising precious time and efforts by scientists.
The image dataset used is self-created and you can contact me for more images of "parthenium hysterophorus".
